    <p class="card-text my-0">Git is a great distributed version control system that can be used to keep track of changes and code for any kind of project. Sometimes, it is helpful to configure a git server to house your team’s projects.

Gitolite provides an access-control layer for a git server, so that you can configure user-based git access without the accompanying operating system user accounts. This provides your git contributors the privileges they need, without exposing your server to other kinds of interaction.

We will be installing these components on an Debian 7.0 VPS. This tutorial assumes that you have a regular user account on this VPS with sudo privileges.

Install Git

Log into your Debian server with your regular user account.

We will be installing git from Debian’s default repositories:

sudo apt-get install git-core


We now have git installed. We will want to configure a few things for git to operate properly.

Install Gitolite

Now that we have git set up correctly, we can install gitolite to manage user access to our repositories.

Gitolite is also available in Debian’s default repositories. Install it with this command:

sudo apt-get install gitolite


Gitolite manages its configuration through git! To set this up properly, we’ll create a operating system user whose sole function is to interact with gitolite.

The operating system user will be called git to make it easy for our collaborators to remember. We will not set a password so that it is only accessible through using the su command.

sudo adduser --system --group --shell /bin/bash --disabled-password git


We now have a user called “git” that will handle gitolite configuration. We need to be able to access this user from a normal account. We will do this by configuring an SSH key associated with git administration.

Configure SSH Keys for Git Administration
On your local computer, which you will be using to administer git and gitolite, you need to create an SSH key pair if you have not done so already.

Note: If you already have a key pair created, you should skip this command to avoid overwriting your SSH keys.

ssh-keygen -t rsa


Accept the default location and press ENTER to configure key-based login without a password.

Copy the public key to the git server by typing:

scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub regular_username@git_server_IP_address:/tmp/git-admin.pub


If you followed the Initial Server Setup article, you will need to allow SSH access to the git user. You can do that by editing /etc/ssh/sshd_config and adding git to the AllowUsers directive. Once you’re done, restart the SSH server:

sudo service ssh restart


Configure Gitolite
The next steps will take place back on our git server. Log back in with your normal user.

We can log in with our “git” user to initialize gitolite with the public key we just transferred.

sudo su - git


Now, we can set up gitolite with the following command:

gl-setup /tmp/git-admin.pub


Hit ENTER to pull the configuration into your editor. Scan the contents to make sure the default configuration will meet your needs. You can always change it later.

When you are finished, save and exit out of the file.

How To Administer Gitolite
Back on your local computer, you can begin administering gitolite.

If you do not already have git installed on this computer, you need to install it with:

sudo apt-get install git-core


First, we need to clone the gitolite information from our git server to our local machine:

git clone git@git_server_IP_address:gitolite-admin


This will create a new directory called gitolite-admin within your current directory. Here, we can make changes to our access policies and then push those changes to the git server.

Add New Users to Gitolite
To add users to your projects, you will need their public keys. Gitolite works by associating the username that will be signing in with the public key with the same name. We will pretend we have a user called john for this demonstration.

On the local machine, we can change into the gitolite-admin directory and see what is inside:

cd gitolite-admin
ls


conf    keydir


Inside, there are two directories: conf and keydir. Unsurprisingly, keydir contains user keys.

You would communicate with “john” and acquire the public key that he plans on using. You would then copy that key into this directory like this:

cp /path/to/johns/public/key.pub ~/gitolite-admin/keydir/john.pub


After that, you need to add the new public key to the git repository.

First, we want to configure the user name and email that will be associated with administrative git actions. Type these commands to configure this:

git config --global user.name "your_name_here"
git config --global user.email "your_email@address.com"


You probably also want to configure git to use the editor of your choice. Type this command to specify your preferences:

git config --global core.editor your_editor_choice


Now, we can add the new file to git:

git add keydir/john.pub


Commit the changes with a message:

git commit -a -m "New user John added"


Push the changes up to the git server to save the results:

git push


Configure Access with Gitolite
When you added the user in the last section, you may have noticed a warning like this:

remote:
remote:         ***** WARNING *****
remote:         the following users (pubkey files in parens) do not appear in the config file:
remote: john(john.pub)


You will receive a message that the new user is not in the config file. This means that the user “john” is known to gitolite, but no access has been created for him.

We can easily add him to our configuration by editing the ~/gitolite-admin/conf/gitolite.conf file.

We will go one step further though and give him his own repository. We will create a repository called johns-project and give him access:

nano ~/gitolite-admin/conf/gitolite.conf
repo    gitolite-admin
RW+     =   git-admin

repo    testing
RW+     =   @all


As you can see, the syntax is pretty simple.

We specify a git repository with the repo keyword followed by its name. Under that, we write the privilege type, an equal sign (=), and the users who should get that access.

Groups can be defined with a line like this:

@group_name = user1 user2 user3


After that, we can refer to a number of users like by referencing the group:

repo    some_repo
RW+     = @group_name


A special group called @all references all users or all repositories, based on the context.

The permissions can be one of these values:

R: Read only access
RW: Can read or push new changes. Cannot delete refs that exist on the git server already.
RW+: Can push destructively, or delete refs on the server.
-: Has no access to the specified content.

We can give “john” full access to a new repository called johns-project by adding these lines to the end of the file:

repo    johns-project
RW+     =       john


Save and close the file.

Now, we can commit this change with a new message:

git commit -a -m "Made John's repo"


Finally, push the changes to the git server:

git push


Now, “john” should be able to clone his project repository with the following command, from the computer where he created the public and private keys:

git clone git@git_server_IP_address:johns-project


Conclusion
You should now have gitolite configured correctly. You should be able to create git users easily without worrying about configuring accompanying operating system users and permissions every time.

If you are managing multiple projects with diverse teams, it is probably best to set up groups that correspond to projects. It might also be helpful to organize your keydir keys into subdirectories based on project. Gitolite will use them the same way, but they will be easier to find for administrative purposes.

    <p class="card-text my-0">GPG, or GNU Privacy Guard, is a public key cryptography implementation. This allows for the secure transmission of information between parties and can be used to verify that the origin of a message is genuine.

In this guide, we will discuss how GPG works and how to implement it. We will be using an Ubuntu 12.04 VPS for this demonstration, but the tools are available on any modern Linux distribution.

How Public Key Encryption Works
A problem that many users face is how to communicate securely and validate the identity of the party they are talking to. Many schemes that attempt to answer this question require, at least at some point, the transfer of a password or other identifying credentials, over an insecure medium.

Ensure That Only the Intended Party Can Read
To get around this issue, GPG relies on a security concept known as public key encryption. The idea is that you can split the encrypting and decrypting stages of the transmission into two separate pieces. That way, you can freely distribute the encrypting portion, as long as you secure the decrypting portion.

This would allow for a one-way message transfer that can be created and encrypted by anyone, but only be decrypted by the designated user (the one with the private decrypting key). If both of the parties create public/private key pairs and give each other their public encrypting keys, they can both encrypt messages to each other.

So in this scenario, each party has their own private key and the other user’s public key.

Validate the Identity of the Sender
Another benefit of this system is that the sender of a message can “sign” the message with their private key. The public key that the receiver has can be used to verify that the signature is actually being sent by the indicated user.

This can prevent a third-party from “spoofing” the identity of someone. It also helps to ensure that the message was transmitted in-full, without damage or file corruption.

Set Up GPG Keys
GPG should be installed by default on Ubuntu 12.04. If it is not, you can install it with:

sudo apt-get install gnupg


To begin using GPG to encrypt your communications, you need to create a key pair. You can do this by issuing the following command:

gpg --gen-key


This will take you through a few questions that will configure your keys.


  Please select what kind of key you want: (1) RSA and RSA (default)
  What keysize do you want? 4096
  Key is valid for? 0
  Is this correct? y
  Real name: your real name here
  Email address: your_email@address.com
  Comment: Optional comment that will be visible in your signature
  Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? O
  Enter passphrase: Enter a secure passphrase here


At this point, it will need to generate the keys using entropy. This is basically a term to describe the amount of unpredictability that exists in a system. GPG uses this entropy to generate a random set of keys.

It is best to open a new terminal and ssh into the VPS while this runs. Install some software, do some work, and just use the machine as much as possible to let it generate the needed entropy.

This process may take a long time, depending on how active you can make your system.

Create a Revocation Certificate
You need to have a way of invalidating your key pair in case there is a security breach, or in case you lose your secret key. There is an easy way of doing this with the GPG software.

This should be done as soon as you make the key pair, not when you need it. This revocation key must be generated ahead of time and kept in a secure, separate location in case your computer is compromised or inoperable. Type:

gpg --gen-revoke your_email@address.com


You will be asked for the reason that it is being revoked. You can choose any of the available options, but since this is being done ahead of time, you won’t have the specifics.

You will then be offered to supply a comment and finally, to confirm the selections.

Afterwards, a revocation certificate will be generated to the screen. Copy and paste this to a secure location, or print it for later use:

Revocation certificate created.

Please move it to a medium which you can hide away; if Mallory gets
access to this certificate he can use it to make your key unusable.
It is smart to print this certificate and store it away, just in case
your media become unreadable.  But have some caution:  The print system of
your machine might store the data and make it available to others!

-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----


How To Import Other Users’ Public Keys
GPG would be pretty useless if you could not accept other public keys from people you wished to communicate with.

You can import someone’s public key in a variety of ways. If you’ve obtained a public key from someone in a text file, GPG can import it with the following command:

gpg --import name_of_pub_key_file


There is also the possibility that the person you are wishing to communicate with has uploaded their key to a public key server. These key servers are used to house people’s public keys from all over the world.

A popular key server that syncs its information with a variety of other servers is the MIT public key server. You can search for people by their name or email address by going here in your web browser:

http://pgp.mit.edu/


You can also search the key server from within GPG by typing the following:

gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu  --search-keys search_parameters


How To Verify and Sign Keys
While you can freely distribute your generated public key file and people can use this to contact you in an encrypted way, there is still an issue of trust in the initial public key transmission.

Verify the Other Person’s Identity
How do you know that the person giving you the public key is who they say they are? In some cases, this may be simple. You may be sitting right next to the person with your laptops both open and exchanging keys. This should be a pretty secure way of identifying that you are receiving the correct, legitimate key.

But there are many other circumstances where such personal contact is not possible. You may not know the other party personally, or you may be separated by physical distance. If you never want to communicate over insecure channels, verification of the public key could be problematic.

Luckily, instead of verifying the entire public keys of both parties, you can simply compare the “fingerprint” derived from these keys. This will give you a reasonable assurance that you both are using the same public key information.

You can get the fingerprint of a public key by typing:

gpg --fingerprint your_email@address.com


pub   4096R/311B1F84 2013-10-04
      Key fingerprint = CB9E C70F 2421 AF06 7D72  F980 8287 6A15 311B 1F84
uid                  Test User &lt;test.user@address.com&gt;
sub   4096R/8822A56A 2013-10-04


This will produce a much more manageable string of numbers to compare. You can compare this string with the person themselves, or someone else who has access to that person.

Sign Their Key
Signing a key tells your software that you trust the key that you have been provided with and that you have verified that it is associated with the person in question.

To sign a key that you’ve imported, simply type:

gpg --sign-key email@example.com


After you’ve signed the key, it means you verify that you trust the person is who he/she claims to be. This can help other people decide whether to trust that person too. If someone trusts you, and they see that you’ve signed this person’s key, they may be more likely to trust their identity too.

You should allow the person whose key you are signing the advantages of your trusted relationship by sending them back the signed key. You can do this by typing:

gpg --export --armor email@example.com


You’ll have to type in your passphrase again. Afterwards, their public key, signed by you, will be spit out on the screen. Send them this, so that they can benefit from gaining your “stamp of approval” when interacting with others.

When they receive this new, signed key, they can import it, adding on the signing information you’ve generated, into their GPG database. They can do this by typing:

gpg --import file_name


How To Make Your Public Key Highly Available
There is not really anything malicious that can happen if unknown people have your public key.

Because of this, it may be beneficial to make your public key easily available. People can then easily find your information to send you secure messages, from the very first communication.

You can send anyone your public key by requesting it from the GPG system:

gpg --armor --export your_email@address.com

. . .


You can then copy and paste this or send this in an appropriate medium.

If you want to publish your key to a key server, you can do it manually through the forms available on most of the server sites.

Another option is to do this through the GPG interface.

Look up your key ID by typing:

gpg --list-keys your_email@address.com


The highlighted portion is your key ID. It is a short way to reference the key to the internal software.

pub   4096R/311B1F84 2013-10-04
uid                  Test User &lt;test.user@address.com&gt;
sub   4096R/8822A56A 2013-10-04


To upload your key to a certain key server, you can then use this syntax:

gpg --send-keys --keyserver pgp.mit.edu key_id


Encrypt and Decrypt Messages with GPG
You can easily encrypt and decrypt messages after you have configured your keys with the other party.

Encrypt Messages
You can encrypt messages using the “–encrypt” flag for GPG. The basic syntax would be:

gpg --encrypt --sign --armor -r person@email.com name_of_file


The parameters basically encrypt the email, sign it with your private key to guarantee that it is coming from you, and generates the message in a text format instead of raw bytes.

You should also include a second “-r” recipient with your own email address if you want to be able to read the message ever. This is because the message will be encrypted with each person’s public key, and will only be able to be decrypted with the associated private key.

So if it was only encrypted with the other party’s public key, you would not be able to view the message again, unless you somehow obtained their private key. Adding yourself as a second recipient encrypts the message two separate times, one for each recipient.

Decrypt Messages
When you receive a message, simply call GPG on the message file:

gpg file_name


The software will prompt you as necessary.

If you have the message as a raw text stream, you can copy and paste it after you just typing gpg without any arguments. You can press “CTRL-D” to signify the end of the message and GPG will decrypt it for you.

Key Maintenance
There are a number of procedures that you may need to use on a regular basis to manage your key database.

To list your available GPG keys that you have from other people, you can issue this command:

gpg --list-keys


Your key information can become outdated if you are relying on information pulled from public key servers. You do not want to be relying on revoked keys, because that would mean you are trusting potentially compromised keys.

You can update the key information by issuing:

gpg --refresh-keys


This will fetch new information from the key servers.

You can pull information from a specific key server by using:

gpg --keyserver key_server --refresh-keys


Conclusion
Using GPG correctly can help you secure your communications with different people. This is extremely helpful, especially when dealing with sensitive information, but also when dealing with regular, every day messaging.

Because of the way that certain encrypted communications can be flagged by monitoring programs, it is recommended to use encryption for everything, not just “secret” data. That will make it more difficult for people to know when you are sending important data or just sending a friendly hello.

GPG encryption is only useful when both parties use good security practices and are vigilant about their other security practices. Educate those who you communicate regularly with about the importance of these practices if you want to have the possibility of cryptographically secure communication.

    <p class="card-text my-0">Yesterday I decided to shorten and clear the urls of my posts once and for all. By clean, I mean short and simple urls without dates, categories or anything else in them, only the post slug. My definition of cleanness also includes not having a slash at the end of the urls. For example, groveld.com/about.

    <p class="card-text my-0">I once mentioned it to a classmate that I use GNU/Linux as the only Operating System at home, and he replied in shock, “That’s used by Hackers? Right?”
That is true. Almost everyone who calls himself/herself a Hacker uses it, but the fear on his face suggested that he meant to say Crackers.
Noooo! Linux users aren’t Crackers. That would be similar to saying that everyone who owns a slide hammer, is a car thief!

    <h5 class="card-title"><a href="/articles/teamspeak-3-server-on-debian-ubuntu" class="card-link">TeamSpeak 3 server on Debian/Ubuntu</a></h5>
    <p class="card-text my-0">It has been a long time since my last post – I’m sorry for that but I didn’t have the time. Anyway I just installed TeamSpeak 3 on a Ubuntu 10.04 for a friend and want to share that info. Getting TeamSpeak running is mostly not the problem but you don’t want to start it after every boot by hand or run it as root. This Howto shows what I did. I assume that all user actions shown in this howto are performed as root or after executing sudo bash.

First you need to create a user under which the TeamSpeak server should run by executing following command:

adduser --disabled-login teamspeak


Now we need to get the software (64bit in my case)
(Take a look if a new version is out when you install your server)

wget http://ftp.4players.de/pub/hosted/ts3/releases/beta-22/teamspeak3-server_linux-amd64-3.0.0-beta22.tar.gz


and extract it

tar xzf teamspeak3-server_linux-amd64-3.0.0-beta22.tar.gz


We move it to a nice place with

mv teamspeak3-server_linux-amd64 /opt/ts3


and give it to the user teamspeak

chown -R teamspeak /opt/ts3


If you take a look into the /opt/ts3 directory you’ll see that there is a already a start/stop script (ts3server_startscript.sh), we will utilize it. Create a init.d file with pasting the content after executing cat &gt; /etc/init.d/teamspeak :

#! /bin/sh
### BEGIN INIT INFO
# Provides:          teamspeak
# Required-Start:    networking
# Required-Stop:
# Default-Start:     2 3 4 5
# Default-Stop:      S 0 1 6
# Short-Description: TeamSpeak Server Daemon
# Description:       Starts/Stops/Restarts the TeamSpeak Server Daemon
### END INIT INFO

set -e

PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
DESC="TeamSpeak Server"
NAME=teamspeak
USER=teamspeak
DIR=/opt/ts3
DAEMON=$DIR/ts3server_startscript.sh
#PIDFILE=/var/run/$NAME.pid
SCRIPTNAME=/etc/init.d/$NAME

# Gracefully exit if the package has been removed.
test -x $DAEMON || exit 0

cd $DIR
sudo -u teamspeak ./ts3server_startscript.sh $1


Now press ENTER and CTRL-D and you’ve inserted the content into the file. Set the permission correctly with

chmod 755 /etc/init.d/teamspeak


and now you can try it out by calling

/etc/init.d/teamspeak start


Take note of the login and token as you will need them later. You can also look for them in the log files in /opt/ts3/logs/. The last thing you need to do now is to make sure the init script is executed at boot time by using following command:

update-rc.d teamspeak defaults


At last if you’ve a firewall running on your system you need to make sure that you open all your ports. To find out which ports are used by teamspeak use following command:

# netstat -lnp | grep ts3
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:10011           0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      30232/ts3server_lin
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:30033           0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      30232/ts3server_lin
udp        0      0 0.0.0.0:9987            0.0.0.0:*                           30232/ts3server_lin


I hope this howto helped someone and write a comment if you found an error or a better way to do something. Now you just need to point your TeamSpeak client to the server and go to the menu entry “permissions -&gt; use token” and copy and past the token from above into the edit box. (only insert the chars behind “token=”)
