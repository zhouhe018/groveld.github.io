      <title>Understanding Group Policy Processing</title>
      <description>Group Policy Processing: You can have local policies, site policies, domain policies, and OU policies within your domain structure. To learn how to best implement Group Policies to serve the organization, you need to understand the order in which the policies are applied.

      <title>Use Gitolite to Control Access to a Git Server</title>
      <description>Git is a great distributed version control system that can be used to keep track of changes and code for any kind of project. Sometimes, it is helpful to configure a git server to house your team’s projects. Gitolite provides an access-control layer for a git server, so that you can configure user-based git access without the accompanying operating system user accounts. This provides your git contributors the privileges they need, without exposing your server...</description>

      <title>How To Use GPG to Encrypt and Sign Messages</title>
      <description>GPG, or GNU Privacy Guard, is a public key cryptography implementation. This allows for the secure transmission of information between parties and can be used to verify that the origin of a message is genuine. In this guide, we will discuss how GPG works and how to implement it. We will be using an Ubuntu 12.04 VPS for this demonstration, but the tools are available on any modern Linux distribution.

      <title>Clean URLs with Jekyll/Apache</title>
      <description>Yesterday I decided to shorten and clear the urls of my posts once and for all. By clean, I mean short and simple urls without dates, categories or anything else in them, only the post slug. My definition of cleanness also includes not having a slash at the end of the urls. For example, groveld.com/about.</description>

      <title>What it really means to Hack</title>
      <description>I once mentioned it to a classmate that I use GNU/Linux as the only Operating System at home, and he replied in shock, “That’s used by Hackers? Right?” That is true. Almost everyone who calls himself/herself a Hacker uses it, but the fear on his face suggested that he meant to say Crackers. Noooo! Linux users aren’t Crackers. That would be similar to saying that everyone who owns a slide hammer, is a car thief!...</description>
